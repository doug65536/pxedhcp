This is a simple LAN boot server that doesn't require you to touch your
DHCP server, can coexist with an existing DHCP server, and provides
a built-in TFTP server.

It uses QT4. This is an early prototype, but it has been tested with
a few VMs and appears to be working.

This project is hosted at https://github.com/doug65536/pxedhcp

It definitely needs more testing. If you try it, please report any
problems you encounter as issues on GitHub.

Builds have only been tested on Linux. I will be adding Windows build
support as soon as possible.
